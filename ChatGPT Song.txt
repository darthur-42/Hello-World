**Title: The Ballad of Dragons and the Eternal Flame**


*(Verse 1)*  
Oh gather ye, ye hearts so bold,  
And hear the tale, the story old,  
Of dragons high and magic bright,  
That danced in realms of endless night.  


The wizards wept, their power grand,  
With spells that stretched across the land,  
But 'neath the skies, where stars did flame,  
The dragons roared, with hearts untamed.


*(Chorus)*  
Fly, oh dragons, fly so high,  
Through the storm and through the sky,  
With wings of fire and eyes of gold,  
The tale of magic shall unfold.  
In shadows deep, in winds that call,  
The dragon's fire will scorch us all.


*(Verse 2)*  
In towers tall, the mages stood,  
Their robes of silk, their hearts of wood,  
They called on forces none could name,  
To bind the beasts, to quell the flame.  


But lo! A dragon fierce did rise,  
With silver scales and crimson eyes,  
Its breath did burn, its roar did quake,  
A force of nature none could shake.


*(Chorus)*  
Fly, oh dragons, fly so high,  
Through the storm and through the sky,  
With wings of fire and eyes of gold,  
The tale of magic shall unfold.  
In shadows deep, in winds that call,  
The dragon's fire will scorch us all.


*(Bridge)*  
In the caverns deep, where shadows creep,  
The dragon sleeps, but does not weep,  
For though its heart is bound by chains,  
It waits, it waits for freedom’s reign.


The wizards tried to seal its might,  
But they did fall to endless night,  
For magic pure and power vast  
Cannot be held, it cannot last.


*(Verse 3)*  
And so the dragons, fierce and free,  
Roamed the lands of mystery,  
With magic in their hearts aflame,  
They forged the world in their own name.


*(Chorus)*  
Fly, oh dragons, fly so high,  
Through the storm and through the sky,  
With wings of fire and eyes of gold,  
The tale of magic shall unfold.  
In shadows deep, in winds that call,  
The dragon's fire will scorch us all.


*(Outro)*  
So raise the glass and toast the skies,  
To dragons bold and wizard’s lies,  
For magic’s power, wild and grand,  
Forever rules this ancient land.
